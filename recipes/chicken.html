        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Place chicken on the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes. 
                Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12 more minutes.
                 An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
